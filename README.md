# Contacts client with React

I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Use **`npm start`** to run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.

# Additional dependences
- react user dom
- styled components
- eslint

# Possible improvements

- Use a library to improve accesibility.
- Use server error responses to provide client specific errors.
- Disable request buttons while server is processing a previous the request.
- Remove leading and trailing white spaces after 1-2s of the change in any input (this feature is already done on the server).
- Add authentication.
- Notify when a user is successfully created or edited.

- Use React Native for small devices.
- Add a search component to the contact list menu.
- Add Log In.
